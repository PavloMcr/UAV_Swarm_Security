# Security

This project includes files related to the development of the security mechanisms such as Jamming detection, GPS spoofing detection and Plausibility check of distance measurements.

## Getting started

Follow the files to navigate. 
The skelletons for Jamming Detection is availiable in the jamming_detection.py file. 
GPS spoofing detection skelleton is availiable in the gps_spoofing_plausibility.py 

## Current Tasks

- [ ] Script for the Jamming detection
- [ ] Script for the GPS spoofing detection
- [ ] Script for the plausibility check of sensor measurements
