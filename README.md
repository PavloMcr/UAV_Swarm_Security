# Security

This project includes files related to the development of the security mechanisms such as Jamming detection, GPS spoofing detection and Plausibility check of distance measurements.

## Getting started

Follow the files to navigate. 
The skelletons for Jamming Detection is availiable in the jamming_detection.py file. 
GPS spoofing detection skelleton is availiable in the gps_spoofing_plausibility.py 

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Set up REQUEST_DATA_STREAM or MAV_CMD_SET_MESSAGE_INTERVAL for message update
- [ ] UWB measurements request and update implementation 
- [ ] Time syncronisation of GPS and UWB
